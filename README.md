# OneSwap

OneSwap is a command-line tool designed to simplify migrating Virtual Machines from vCenter to OpenNebula. It supports `virt-v2v` and `qemu-img` conversion, and is able to import Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) previously exported from vCenter/ESXi environments.

OneSwap has been used in the field with a 96% success rate in converting VMs automatically, greatly simplifying and speeding up the migration process.

The full documentation is available in the [OneSwap Wiki](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-swap/wiki). For guides on importing OVAs and VMDKs, see [Managing OVAs and VMDKs](https://docs.opennebula.io/7.0/software/migration_from_vmware/import_ova/) in the [OpenNebula documentation](https://docs.opennebula.io/7.0/).
